Wisnu Foundation is the local implementing partner for 2C Denpasar and is helping to establish a model waste management system in the city working with local TPSTs (integrated waste facilities) and waste banks in metropolitan Denpasar. The primary goal is to develop standard management tools through the use of geospatial data and ICT technology and to improve overall management, services and planning through participatory mapping. Subsequently the lessons learned will be replicated at similar facilities in surrounding regions of Denpasar.
