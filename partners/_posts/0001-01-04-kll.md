Kathmandu Living Labs (KLL) is the local implementing partner of the 2C (Secondary Cities) Pokhara project and works in cooperation with the American Association of Geographers and the United States Department of State. The 2C Pokhara project focuses on the development of disaster resilience and emergency management in the city of Pokhara. Kathmandu Living Labs helps local partners and communities within the city of Pokhara to create a robust OpenStreetMap (OSM) data of their city and develop a community which is able to update, maintain and make effective use the collected data. In the long run, the 2C Pokhara project envisions the formation of a geographic information sensitized community that is able to use the collected OSM data to mobilise strategically, create applications and use tools such as Quakemap.org in the advent of a major disaster.
