          Mobile tools for data generation provide a method to actively engage in data collection for different stakeholders. Intersecting these tools with web-based maps and geographic information systems are the basis for dynamic mapping â€“ one where the map is interactive and where the data lends itself to analysis for generating new information. Within the current milieu, maps are dynamic on a number of levels: scale (ability to zoom); turning on and off data layers; creating map animations. Maps are also dynamic with respect to what and how data are collected, who participates in the collection process, and who analyzes the data and uses it.

          This symposium is an opportunity to unpack dynamic mapping as it applies to the suite of tools under examination here. The symposium will also lay the groundwork for a network of users to identify intersections and discuss lessons learned on how improvements can be made from data development to stakeholder involvement in the context of secondary cities. Secondary cities are non-primary cities that often serve as regional hubs for commerce, services, and governance, with populations that can range from 100,000 to 5 million. They are generally experiencing rapid urbanization and are often the fastest growing areas in developing countries, experiencing unplanned growth and development with limited geospatial data.

          The ability to combine data from both private enterprise (telcos, banks, etc) and government allows continuous mapping of variables relevant to good government and sustainable development. The key is a framework that protects individual privacy and private interests.

Secondary Cities in the developing world are rapidly growing urban areas that are regional hubs for commerce, services, and governance in developing countries that often do not have adequate planning mechanisms for future development and growth. This symposium will focus on the foremost data collection tools and technologies used to map urbanization in such cities. It is part of the Secondary Cities initiative, a global collaboration of universities and organizations supported by the Humanitarian Information Unit of the Office of the Geographer of the State Department.
