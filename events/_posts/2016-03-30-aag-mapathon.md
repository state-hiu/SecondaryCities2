The Mapathon promoted themes of shared humanitarian interest, and mapping was coordinated through the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team’s Tasking Manager, with imagery services provided by the Office of the Geographer’s Humanitarian Information Unit. The three daily themes were Secondary Cities and Urban Resilience, Disaster Preparedness and Response, and Health and Infectious Disease.
