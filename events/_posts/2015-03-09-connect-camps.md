The Connect Camps offer an opportunity for alumni of the Mandela Washington Fellowship to share the professional skills and networks they acquired from the <a href="https://youngafricanleaders.state.gov/washington-fellowship/" target="_blank">Young African Leaders Initiative</a> with other young African leaders in their rural communities.
