          Secondary Cities experience a particular set of challenges which can be met in part by leveraging appropriate technological and mapping solutions. The ArcGIS Platform offers opensource technologies which equip organizations and governments with the ability to not only easily collect data, but to disseminate it back to the community to leverage collective knowledge and insights. With this in mind, this session will introduce and demonstrate a suite of tools and will consider two groups of users: data administrators and community actors. We will cover a full flow of survey configuration and data collection using Survey 123, data dissemination using ArcGIS Open Data, and ways to create data narratives and share knowledge using Story Maps.

    body: |
          Innovation requires more than a good idea. It requires a leap in thinking that veers on the irrational. The first step is to reconsider our general assumptions about the future. When we try to predict the future, we tend to forget that more than one kind of future is possible and that all possible futures exist simultaneously. To consider the state of Geography, mapping and observable urban trends in light of all possible futures - it is clear that the distinction between the possible, the probable, and the most preferred futures have not been thoroughly explored. This is partially because within geography we tend to focus on a structuralist interpretation of “what is” while believing the most probable future is dependent on random chance and market dynamics. Our shared futures are equally subject to the patterns in human cognition, the architecture of information systems, and the design of the daily objects we use to channel thoughts into actions. Equipped with new ways to engage our geographic futures from these domains, we are liberated to ask more of our tools, our methods, our cities and how we live within them. Let’s get started.
