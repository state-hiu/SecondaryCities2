Critical to predicting the impact of urbanization on environmental and development outcomes, is to understand how urban areas are changing. Land use science has significantly added to our knowledge of urban expansion and its impact on non-urban landscapes, such as agriculture and forests. However, to understand how urbanization will effect emissions and vulnerability, change within urban areas must be monitored. In this talk, we discuss the potential of new spatio-temporal remote-sensing data to describe the dynamics of the built environments, energy infrastructure, and activities within urban areas. Applying novel satellite sensors and techniques such as SeaWinds, DMSP-OLS, and Suomi-NPP VIIRS, we present two recent analyses that characterize long-term and short-term patterns of urban change in developing countries. We discuss how these analyses add to our knowledge of the social, political, and cultural activities that shape energy consumption and vulnerability. </h6></div><script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="22f7d917a1764cd8a9fe85da06ec5ee1" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script><div style="text-align:left"><h6 style="text-transform: none;">Gabriel Moreno, Harvard University</h6></div><script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="21450eb9ac6d47b6acb0a82fed47ae85" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script><div style="text-align:left"><h6 style="text-transform: none;">Kirstin Miller, Ecocity Builders</h6></div><script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="5bbbddcb95e5487d987cbd47b3f7970c" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script><div style="text-align:left"><h6 style="text-transform: none;">'
