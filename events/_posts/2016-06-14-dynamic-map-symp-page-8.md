           Remote sensing and mapping technologies are increasingly a critical component of humanitarian assistance operations during both armed conflict and natural disaster contexts. This session discusses common use cases of these platforms and techniques for providing general situational awareness to responders and affected populations, as well as specific applications of them to certain types of aid operations.

          While the global North has a long history of utilizing GIS for spatial decision making, its usage in India has been relatively recent. Further, the concept of citizen participation in planning activities is relatively new in India, and its effectiveness is shaped by multiple contextual factors. Because of the recent emphasis on collaborative governance and transparency, GIS is used to enhance citizen participation through e-governance projects and through Public Participation GIS. This paper aims to examine the complexities of embedded in citizen participation through GIS based knowledge production in urban communities in India. Through empirical findings, it aims to demonstrate how cultural, political and technological factors differentially shape the ways GIS is being used in enhancing citizen participation in urban planning in India.

           "The presentation focuses on the two phases of the AccraMobile Project - a collaboration between the Accra Municipal Assembly (AMA), the Agence francaise de développement and Concordia University’s (Montreal, Canada) TRIP Lab. Impetus for the project originated from the AMA who sought to construct a documentary structure (route registry, protocols for data collection and mapping) for planning and passenger use of the Trotro bus network of Accra in Ghana. Phase 1 of the project involved: the adaptation of the TRIP Lab’s smartphone travel survey app, DataMobile; development of a data collection protocol; administration of Trotro route data collection; and the dynamic mapping of the routes. Data from Phase 1 has subsequently been trans- formed into Google’s General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format, and made accessible to the local community through a hackathon and map designed to be easily readable to Trotro users. While Phase 1 sought to gather information on the nature and breadth of the Trotro network for planning purposes, Phase 2 is directed primarily towards Trotro operators. It involves a great deal of engagement with operators with the aim of better understanding Trotro operations and developing business cases to finance a feet renewal program."
