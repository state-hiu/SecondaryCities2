title: Field Papers One Pager
subtitle: 
abstract: "Field Papers are a way to create maps for field data collection. Individuals target a study site, zoom in to the appropriate scale and can print an “atlas” of the gridded site. Base maps can be either OpenStreetMap or satellite imagery. The printed base maps can be taken out into the field for collecting data and writing notes."
