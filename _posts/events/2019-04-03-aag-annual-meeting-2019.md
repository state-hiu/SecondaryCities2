       Since 2015, the Secondary Cities (2C) Initiative has developed a global network of universities, non-governmental organizations, and local government to generate local, geospatial data for emergency preparedness, resiliency, and human security.  Focusing on low-income and mid-income countries, the 2C Initiative spans 16 cities in as many countries.  A panel will discuss the status of the initiative, lessons learned, and highlight initial outcomes.  The 2C Initiative hosts the 2C Geonode where all data are posted and shared.  Challenges to implementing a global project are both technical (i.e., interoperability across tools and platforms) and cultural (i.e., languages).  Success is measured in the 2C partner efforts to generate data and the training of the next generation of geospatial experts.  Panelists included Melinda Laituri (Colorado State University), Laura Cline (Office of the Geographer, US Department of State), Gaston Mbonglou (US Cameroon Chamber of Commerce), Lorena Ramirez (2C Esmeraldas, Universidad de San Francisco de Quito, Ecuador).
