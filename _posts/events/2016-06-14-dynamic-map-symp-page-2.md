          Most private organizations and government agencies are looking to reduce field data collection costs and improve the effectiveness of their field data collection. As a growing trend mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are a great way to do that. In order to get the best bang for the buck you need to use a commercial off-the-shelf solution that will adequately replace the multitude of tools that are taken into the field today, reduce time in the field, and collect a wide range of field data. Spike accomplishes that task.

          What is the role of open, accessible data in secondary cities, and how does rapid mapping and insight into location data help those cities achieve their goals? In this talk, we will look specifically at the evolution of open data and how it has evolved to be a tool for cities to communicate, prioritize and make decisions with less overhead and complexity than ever before. As cities make their data more open and transparent, location and demographics can guide leaders through actionable insights and informed decisions. We will look at the array of mapping tools and examples of how it has been successful in helping city leaders achieve goals.
