Denpasar is the capital of Bali and has the highest growth rate in Bali Province. Situated on the Bali Island, it is a major tourist destination.

The tourist trade has influenced cultural change.  Informal growth and the expanding tourist industry have fueled significant problems for waste management, particularly marine and ocean debris.
