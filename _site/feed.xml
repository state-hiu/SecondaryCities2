        <title>Pokhara, Nepal</title>

The Seti River and tributaries flow from these mountains and freshwater lakes are located throughout the city.  The same geological features that contribute to Pokhara’s natural beauty cause its volatility.  The United Nations Development Programme ranks Nepal 11th in the world for its susceptibility to natural disasters that include earthquakes, floods, landslides, drought, and sinkholes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kharkiv, Ukraine</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Kharkiv was founded in 1654 as a small fortress that grew to become a major center of Ukrainian culture within the Russian Empire.  The city functioned as the first capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic until 1935, after which the capital was relocated to Kiev. Kharkiv is the administrative center of Kharkiv Oblast and of the surrounding Kharkiv district.  The city’s population is the second largest in Ukraine.  Although the majority of the population is Ukrainian both in nationality and ethnicity, Kharkiv’s largest minority is of Russian descent due to its history and proximity to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
